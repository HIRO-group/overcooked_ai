# Motivation: Unequal kitchens. The middle kitchen is by far the best kitchen,
# but if everyone takes the middle kitchen it will reduce the overall performance.
# Agents must decide how to use the different kitchens. Service can also be seperated
# easily adding alternative strategies (e.g. one person per kitchen vs 2 in the
# middle kitchen + 1 that just serves)
