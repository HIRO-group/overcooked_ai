# Motivation: Long onion. Path to onions is long and it is
# easy to block another chef if two people try to naively
# get onions (Probably hard for SP here), but there is only
# a single pot. Agents should learn to stockpile onions
# using counters. Agents also have to be very careful as only
# a single chef should grab a plate at a time
